# ABOUT

TINYRIIICK! Hold this laser for me, lugnut. Aw snap, you just cut your own foot clean off with nanosecond precision! Nice going, ya moog. What am I going to do with an extra foot?! That's gonna itch, Lean John Silver, fair warning. If you want something done right... like this b-billion dollar (burp) technology from the formless Void. Anyway, try not to let your little blood-loss mind wander while I tell you about my utterly transcendental build tool.

I'm tinyrick (TINYRICK!) and I build Rust projects. With tinyrick, you configure your build in the same normal Rust code as the rest of your project. Or keep picking your nose with make, it's up to you.

Look at my pants! tinyrick! You think my pants are one size fits all? No, of course not! So get the pants that fit you. Get the `tinyrick.rs` that fits your workflow, snowflake. Task dependency trees, get em while they're hot! Segfaults, get em while they're not.

Don't shell out, lib out. Your build is more portable that way. Holy Maven, put that foot on some ice! Who knows, maybe fair market feet prices will go up next year! tinyricktinyricktinyrick. If you look closely, that last period is actually a *micro* rick rendered in ASCII; even tinier tinyrick!

The included [example](example) project demonstrates how to build projects with tinyrick. For more examples, see [ios7crypt-rs](https://github.com/mcandre/ios7crypt-rs).
